# Sample Calculation

The area of the fraction is $\frac{1}{2} bh$. Our $b$ is the base of the triangle, which is simply the side length ($b = s$). Our $h$ is the height of the triangle, which is decided to be half the side length: $h = \frac{1}{2} s$.

$A = \frac{1}{2} bh$ 

$A = \frac{1}{2} s \times \frac{1}{2} s$

$A = \frac{1}{4} s^2 $

Let's take 0.5 inches as the side unit
$0.5 \text{ in} * \frac{1 \text{ unit}{6.59218 \text{ in} } \approx 0.07585 \text{ unit} $

We have a conversion factor of $6.59218$ units (in other words, conversion from the graph to the inches in real life).

Let's plug this side length into the area:

$A = \frac{1}{4} (0.07585)^2 = 0.001438 \text{ unit}^2 $

To figure out the volume, we simply multiply the area by the length of the foamboard. The length of the foamboard is $0.5 \text{ cm}$. Let's convert to our units:

$v = 0.5 \text{ cm} \times \frac{1 \text{ in}}{2.54 \text{ cm}} \times \frac{1 \text{ unit}}{6.59218 \text{ in}} \approx 0.02986 \text{ units}$

The final volume is:

$V = 0.001438 \times 0.02986 = 0.00004294 \text{ unit}^3$

Note that if we were to convert to inches, then we can apply the conversion factor: 

$V = 0.00004294 \text{ unit}^3 * \frac{(6.59218)^3 \text{ in}^3}{1 \text{ unit}^3} = 0.01230125 \text{ in}^3 $

Which is the same area as calculated in the spreadsheet.
